# Rosbag Editor

If you need to:

- remove one or more topics from a [rosbag](http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag).
- change the duration of the rosbag (initial and final time).
- rename a topic.
- change the compression type.
- remove specific transformations from your **/tf**.

and, most importantly:

- you dislike complicated [command line interfaces](http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag/Commandline#filter) as much as I do.

Then this application is the right for you.
